Whether you're documenting your project or sharing what you've learned, good writing makes a big difference. Here are a few principles that help.

## Lead with the problem

Start by stating what your reader is trying to solve. This gives context and helps them decide if the post is relevant.

## Use short paragraphs

Dense blocks of text are hard to scan. Keep paragraphs to 2–4 sentences when possible. Break up long sections with headings.

## Add code examples

Code speaks. Show working examples rather than describing everything in prose. Comment the tricky parts.

## End with next steps

Tell readers what to do next — try something, read another post, or leave feedback. A clear CTA keeps the conversation going.

That's it. Keep it simple, be useful, and ship it.
