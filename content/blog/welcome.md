This is your first blog post. The blog is powered by **Markdown** files stored in the `content/blog` directory. Each file needs frontmatter with `title`, `date`, and `excerpt` fields.

## How it works

1. **Add a new post** — Create a `.md` file in `content/blog/` with the required frontmatter.
2. **Write in Markdown** — Use standard Markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, and more.
3. **Automatic listing** — New posts appear on the blog index page sorted by date.

## Example code block

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## What's next?

- Customize the styling in `globals.css`
- Add more features like tags or categories
- Connect to a CMS if you prefer a graphical editor

Happy writing! 🚀
